## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **LM Studio** - Download and install from [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
3. **OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B model** - Download through LM Studio

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Setup LM Studio
1. Open LM Studio
2. Download the OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B model
3. Start the local server at `http://localhost:1234`
4. Ensure the model is loaded and ready to accept requests

### Step 3: Prepare Data
1. Place your nursing PDF files in the `data/` directory
2. The application will automatically process the PDF on first run
3. Embeddings will be cached in `embedded_knowledge.json`

### Step 4: Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

### Chat Interface
1. Ask questions about nursing protocols, procedures, or guidelines
2. The system will search the knowledge base and provide relevant answers
3. Chat history is maintained during the session

### Fluid Calculator
1. Open the sidebar and find the "Fluid Calculator" section
2. Enter patient weight and age
3. Select the appropriate scenario (Maintenance, Resuscitation, or Deficit)
4. Click "Calculate" to get fluid requirements

### Nursing Quiz
1. Click "Start Quiz" in the sidebar
2. Answer questions based on the nursing knowledge base
3. Progress through all questions using the "Next Question" button
4. View your score and feedback at the end
5. Use "Retake Quiz" to try again with different questions

## Technical Details

### PDF Processing
- Uses `pdfplumber` for text and table extraction
- Implements intelligent text chunking with sentence boundary detection
- Creates embeddings using `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct`

### Embedding and Retrieval
- Stores embeddings in JSON format for quick loading
- Uses cosine similarity for relevance matching
- Configurable similarity threshold for quality control

### LLM Integration
- RESTful API integration with LM Studio
- Configurable system messages for different response types
- Error handling and connection validation

### Fluid Calculations
- Implements pediatric fluid calculation standards
- Holliday-Segar method for maintenance fluids
- Standard resuscitation and deficit formulas
- Age and weight-based calculations

## Configuration

Modify `config.py` to adjust:
- LM Studio connection settings
- Embedding model parameters
- Quiz generation settings
- UI themes and styling
- File paths and locations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **LM Studio Connection Error**
   - Ensure LM Studio is running at `http://localhost:1234`
   - Check that the model is loaded and active
   - Verify no firewall blocking the connection

2. **PDF Processing Fails**
   - Ensure PDF file exists in the `data/` directory
   - Check file permissions and readability
   - Verify PDF is not corrupted or password-protected

3. **Embedding Model Download**
   - First run may take time to download the embedding model
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Check available disk space (model is ~1GB)

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Large PDFs may require more RAM
   - Consider reducing chunk size in config
   - Close other applications if needed
