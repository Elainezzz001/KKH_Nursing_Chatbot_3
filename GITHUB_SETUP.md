# GitHub Setup Instructions

## üìã Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Name your repository (e.g., `kkh-nursing-chatbot`)
4. Add a description: "KKH Nursing Chatbot - AI-powered assistant for nursing professionals"
5. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/kkh-nursing-chatbot.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Use the GitHub URL from the repository page
GitHub will show you the exact commands after creating the repository. They will look like:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
